## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (version 18.0 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js) or **yarn** package manager
- **Git** (for cloning the repository) - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)
- **MongoDB Atlas Account** (for database) - [Sign up here](https://cloud.mongodb.com/)
- **VS Code** (recommended code editor) - [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## Installation

### Method 1: Clone from Repository

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Open your terminal or VS Code integrated terminal and run:
   \`\`\`bash
   git clone <your-repository-url>
   cd bmi-calculator
   \`\`\`

### Method 2: Download from v0

1. **Download the Project**:
   If you downloaded the project from v0, extract the ZIP file to your desired directory.

2. **Open in VS Code**:
   Open VS Code and use `File > Open Folder` to open the project directory.
   Alternatively, if you downloaded a `.zip` file from v0, extract it to your desired directory and open the folder in VS Code.

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (`Ctrl+`` or `View > Terminal`) and navigate into the project directory. Then, install the necessary Node.js packages:

   \`\`\`bash
   npm install
   \`\`\`

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a file named `.env.local` in the root of your project. You can do this directly in VS Code's Explorer panel. This file will store your sensitive environment variables, such as your MongoDB connection string.

   ```plaintext
   # MongoDB Connection String (replace with your actual connection string)
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster-url>/<database-name>?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=<appName>

   # Optional: Database name (defaults to 'bmi_calculator' if not set)
   DB_NAME=bmi_calculator

   # Optional: Environment
   NODE_ENV=development
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
   \`\`\`
   **Important**: Make sure to replace the placeholders (`<username>`, `<password>`, `<cluster-url>`, and `<appName>`) with your actual MongoDB Atlas credentials and cluster details. The `DB_NAME` should match the database you intend to use (e.g., `bmi_calculator`).

## Database Setup (MongoDB Atlas)

If you don't have a MongoDB Atlas cluster set up, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Cluster**:
   - Sign up or log in to [MongoDB Atlas](https://cloud.mongodb.com/).
   - Create a new "Shared Cluster" (M0 is free).
   - Choose your preferred cloud provider and region.

2. **Create a Database User**:
   - In your Atlas project, go to "Database Access" under "Security".
   - Click "Add New Database User".
   - Choose a strong username and password. Remember these, as they will be part of your `MONGODB_URI`.
   - Grant "Read and write to any database" privileges for simplicity, or more granular access if preferred.

3. **Configure Network Access**:
   - Go to "Network Access" under "Security".
   - Click "Add IP Address".
   - For local development, add your current IP address.
   - **For Vercel deployment**, it is highly recommended to add `0.0.0.0/0` (Allow Access from Anywhere). This allows Vercel's dynamic IP addresses to connect to your database. You can restrict this later if needed.

4. **Get Connection String**:
   - Go to "Databases" in the left navigation.
   - Click "Connect" on your cluster.
   - Select "Connect your application".
   - Choose "Node.js" and the latest version.
   - Copy the provided connection string. This is your `MONGODB_URI`.

## Usage

### Running the Application Locally

Once you have installed the dependencies and configured your environment variables, you can run the development server from your VS Code integrated terminal:

\`\`\`bash
npm run dev
\`\`\`

The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Using the BMI Calculator

1. **Input Details**: On the main page, enter your name (optional), select your gender, and input your height (in cm), weight (in kg), and age (optional).
2. **Calculate BMI**: Click the "Calculate BMI" button.
3. **View Results**: You will be redirected to the results page, displaying your BMI score, category, and personalized health tips.
4. **Language Switch**: Use the globe icon button in the top right corner to toggle between English and Indonesian.
5. **Mark Tips Complete**: On the results page, you can mark personalized tips as "Complete" to track your progress.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Database disconnected" or "Failed to connect to MongoDB"**:
  - **Check `MONGODB_URI`**: Ensure it's correctly formatted and includes your username and password.
  - **MongoDB Atlas Network Access**: Make sure `0.0.0.0/0` (Allow Access from Anywhere) is added to your IP Whitelist in MongoDB Atlas.
  - **Database User Credentials**: Verify the username and password for your database user in MongoDB Atlas.
  - **Vercel Environment Variables**: If deployed, ensure the `MONGODB_URI` is correctly set in your Vercel project's environment variables. Redeploy after any changes.

- **Validation Errors on Input**:
  - Ensure height is between 50-300 cm and weight is between 20-500 kg.
  - Name should be 2-50 characters and contain only letters and spaces.
  - Age should be between 1-120 years.

- **"Failed to calculate BMI"**:
  - Check your network connection.
  - Ensure both height and weight fields are filled with positive numbers.
  - Review your server logs (if running locally or on Vercel) for more specific error messages from the API.

- **Data Table Loading Issues**:
  - Check the `/api/health` endpoint to verify database connectivity.
  - Clear browser cache and cookies if experiencing persistent issues.
  - Verify that your MongoDB user has proper read permissions.

- **Export Functionality Problems**:
  - Ensure your browser allows file downloads.
  - Check that the data exists and matches your filter criteria.
  - Try exporting smaller datasets if experiencing timeout issues.

## Performance Optimization

### Database Indexes
The application uses optimized MongoDB indexes for better query performance:

\`\`\`javascript
// Recommended indexes for optimal performance
db.users.createIndex({ "name": 1 })
db.users.createIndex({ "currentCategory": 1 })
db.users.createIndex({ "gender": 1 })
db.users.createIndex({ "lastCalculation": -1 })
db.users.createIndex({ "currentBmi": 1 })
db.users.createIndex({ "age": 1 })
db.users.createIndex({ "isAnonymous": 1 })

// Compound indexes for common filter combinations
db.users.createIndex({ "gender": 1, "currentCategory": 1 })
db.users.createIndex({ "isAnonymous": 1, "lastCalculation": -1 })
\`\`\`

### Large Dataset Handling
- **Pagination**: Efficient pagination prevents memory issues with large datasets
- **Selective Projection**: Only necessary fields are retrieved from the database
- **Query Optimization**: Optimized MongoDB aggregation pipelines
- **Connection Pooling**: Proper database connection management
